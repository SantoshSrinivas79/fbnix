# fbnix
Agent library for scraping Facebook

This library is in early development. The intention is the ability to scrape Facebook pages and groups (something Facebook does not provide full APIs for). I created this to build services that can pull updates from pages (such as events) without having to join Facebook.

Fbnix uses Puppeteer (headless Chromium) to render and scrape data from Facebook.
